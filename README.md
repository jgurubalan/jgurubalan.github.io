## Research Profile

I am a medical doctor and computational researcher working at the intersection of clinical reasoning, mechanistic biology, and systems-level data modelling.

My work conceptualises disease as an interacting system rather than a collection of isolated variables. I design modular, interpretable analytical architectures that translate high-dimensional biological data into mechanistically coherent and clinically actionable insight.
