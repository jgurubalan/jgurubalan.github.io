# Independent Technical Systems Projects

## Amateur Radio Systems Engineering  
**Callsigns:** VU24JD (India) | M7JKG (UK)

Designed and deployed Raspberry Pi–based APRS iGate systems integrating RF hardware, digital communication protocols, and Linux-based infrastructure.

Configured end-to-end signal routing, protocol handling, and network interfacing to enable reliable packet transmission between RF and internet gateways.

**Technical Focus**
- Linux-based system configuration  
- RF-to-internet protocol bridging  
- Network routing and packet handling  
- Hardware–software integration  
- System reliability and monitoring  

This project demonstrates applied systems engineering, protocol-level configuration, and infrastructure design outside formal research environments.

## Local AI Systems Deployment (In Development)

Developing a self-hosted large language model (LLM) system deployed on Raspberry Pi infrastructure to enable low-latency, voice-accessible interaction.

The project integrates:

- Local model execution  
- API orchestration  
- Hardware-level input/output handling  
- Telephony interface integration  
- Edge-based AI deployment  

**Technical Focus**
- Edge computing infrastructure  
- Real-time system orchestration  
- Private AI deployment  
- Human–machine interface engineering  

This work reflects applied AI infrastructure design and real-time systems integration.
