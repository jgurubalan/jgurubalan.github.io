## Microbiome Network Modelling Framework

### Problem
Standard microbiome analyses emphasise taxa-level abundance changes, limiting system-level interpretation.

### Approach
Designed a staged analytical pipeline progressing from diversity profiling to correlation-based graph modelling.

### Implementation
- Prevalence and abundance filtering
- Permutation-based hypothesis testing
- Network topology construction
- Bipartite and projected network modelling
- Python-based reproducible workflows

### Outcome
Generated interpretable network structures demonstrating dysbiosis as structural reorganisation rather than isolated taxa shifts.

## HLA Imputation Compatibility Pipeline

### Problem
Legacy genotype reference panels incompatible with modern HLA-TAPAS / MINIMAC workflows.

### Approach
Engineered modular transformation layers preserving allele structure while enabling compatibility.

### Implementation
- Format transformation utilities
- QC validation pipeline
- Workflow modularisation
- Reproducible integration into imputation frameworks

### Outcome
Enabled modern imputation of historical datasets without structural data loss.

## Doctoral Research – Tumour–Microenvironment Systems Modelling
### MPhil & PhD Cancer Biology – University of Sheffield

##### Research Question: How does therapeutic modulation influence tumour progression and bone microenvironment dynamics in multiple myeloma?
Systems Perspective : Investigated tumour progression as a coupled biological system involving malignant plasma cells, bone remodelling dynamics, and survival outcomes. Integrated longitudinal in vivo modelling with structural imaging and cellular analysis to examine disease evolution across defined stages.
##### Experimental Architecture:  Longitudinal murine modelling • MicroCT-based bone quantification • Multiphoton imaging • Flow cytometry • Staged therapeutic intervention design.
##### Intellectual Contribution:  Characterised stage-specific disease progression and evaluated timing-dependent therapeutic effects within a dynamic microenvironmental framework.

## Translational Modelling of Bone Metastasis
### MSc Molecular Medicine – University of Sheffield

Developed and characterised a murine model to investigate early tumour cell homing and bone turnover dynamics in prostate cancer metastasis. Integrated structural imaging, biochemical turnover markers, and histomorphometry to analyse host–tumour interaction as a dynamic biological system.

## Analytical Orientation
My approach is defined by architectural thinking: I prioritise structural robustness of analytical workflows, interpretability of outputs, and systems-level reasoning across biological scales — from cellular microenvironments to high-dimensional computational networks.
