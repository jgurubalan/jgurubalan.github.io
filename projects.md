## Microbiome Network Modelling Framework

### Problem
Standard microbiome analyses emphasise taxa-level abundance changes, limiting system-level interpretation.

### Approach
Designed a staged analytical pipeline progressing from diversity profiling to correlation-based graph modelling.

### Implementation
- Prevalence and abundance filtering
- Permutation-based hypothesis testing
- Network topology construction
- Bipartite and projected network modelling
- Python-based reproducible workflows

### Outcome
Generated interpretable network structures demonstrating dysbiosis as structural reorganisation rather than isolated taxa shifts.

## HLA Imputation Compatibility Pipeline

### Problem
Legacy genotype reference panels incompatible with modern HLA-TAPAS / MINIMAC workflows.

### Approach
Engineered modular transformation layers preserving allele structure while enabling compatibility.

### Implementation
- Format transformation utilities
- QC validation pipeline
- Workflow modularisation
- Reproducible integration into imputation frameworks

### Outcome
Enabled modern imputation of historical datasets without structural data loss.
