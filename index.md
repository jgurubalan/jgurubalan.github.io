## Physician | Computational Biologist | Systems Researcher 
I am a medical doctor (Emergency Medicine) and computational researcher working at the intersection of clinical reasoning, mechanistic biology, and systems-level data modelling. My work focuses on designing interpretable analytical architectures for complex biological datasets, particularly in settings where traditional single-variable approaches fail to capture emergent system behaviour.
Across experimental and computational domains, I conceptualise disease as an interacting system rather than a collection of isolated measurements. My objective is to develop modular, reusable analytical frameworks that translate high-dimensional biological data into mechanistically coherent and clinically actionable insight.
