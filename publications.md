# Manuscript in Preparation (2025)

## Network-Based Structural Modelling of Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis

**Status:** Drafting stage  
**Role:** Lead author  

This manuscript presents a systems-level analytical framework for modelling gut microbiome dysbiosis as structural reorganisation within an interacting ecological network.  

The study integrates high-dimensional filtering, permutation-based hypothesis testing, and graph-theoretical topology assessment to characterise emergent microbial community architecture across disease states.
